**Assignment 1** examines the 1D diffusion equation, including extensive stability analysis and description of the effect of step size on convergence rate.

**Assignment 2** solves the diffusion equation in 1D spherical coordinates and 2D cartesian coordinates. The solution in cartesian coordinates is applied to a pool, to model the heat throughout the day at various times of the year in Boulder, CO, using NOAA data.

**Assignment 3** applies the techniques from assignments 1 and 2 and solves the diffusion equation to model the propagation of the scent from a bag of chips from one classroom to the next.
